# Robot Power Distribution Board v3

For this revision, I fixed the cap silkscreens, which necessitated shifting some things around.

Assembly:
1. Solder the 2x8 headers.
2. Solder the voltage regulators. Screw them in if desired.
3. Solder in the switches.
4. Solder in the terminals.
5. Solder in the 100uF capacitors.
6. Solder in the 1000uF capacitor.

Usage:
* Wire the battery into the power terminal.
* Wire the motor controller to the motor terminal.
* Connect up parts to the appropriate rail.
