Test plan
=========

Input voltage: 8V

1. Set up 8Ω load resistor on motor controller to test 1A through
   terminal.
2. Set up a 2x1Ω load resistor network in series with a 4Ω load resistor
   on the 3.3V rail to supply 733mA, close to 800mA rating.
3. Move this resistor setup to the 5V rail to test with 1.15A, close to
   1.1A rating.
